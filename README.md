# Altium Custom Component Library

This repository contains my personal collection of custom-made schematic symbols and PCB footprints for use in Altium Designer.


## How to Use

To use these components, download the repository and add the `.SchLib` and `.PcbLib` files to your project, or compile them into an Integrated Library (`.IntLib`).
